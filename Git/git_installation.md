# Git installation

Downloads for each operating system are available on Git's website: https://git-scm.com/downloads. Select the appropriate version.

## Mac
First check to see if it is already installed by running the following command in terminal:
```
which git
```
This should print something like:
```
/usr/bin/git
```
If you get a similar prompt, git is installed. Otherwise, download from the website.

## Windows
Opening the file should start the installation. Going with all the default options works just fine.

To open git, just press the Windows button and type 'git bash'. To open git bash at a given location, just open the folder, right click and select: open `git bash here`

## Linux 
Git comes installed with Ubuntu. To make sure it is installed, check by running the following command in terminal:
```
which git
```
This should print something like:
```
/usr/bin/git
```
If you get a similar prompt, git is installed. Otherwise, use the following command from the terminal
```
sudo apt install git
```
or download from the website.
